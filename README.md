# MOBIUS-LOOPSTATION
This to make an diy loopstation using keyboard input instead of midi input, using an arduino leonardo, due or pro micro
I made this to duplicate Ed Sheeran's Chewie Monsta, but much easier working.
Please give me credit and send me thanks, if you find my codes helpful, I Spend a lot of time on this
